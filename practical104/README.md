This folder contains codes from practicals in week 4

use gcc -o program program.c -lm to compile the file. 

trapezodial-v2.c
-a script calculates values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0,60] for every 5 degrees increment, then calculates the area using the reapezodial rule. (conversion of degrees to radians is coded in a function.)

trapezodial-v3.c
-a script calculates the area under a curve using the trapezodial rule. (this version have the converstion of degrees to radians, and the formula for the calculation of the area coded in two separate functions)
